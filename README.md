Technologies used:

- React.js
- Material UI Icons
- FlipMove for feed posts animation
- Redux for state management
- Cloud Firestore for our remote database and Firebase authentication for login and register option
- BEM system notation

Struggles/Learning curve?

- Redux still but the second time around it was easier to follow the syntax and how it all connected the components

To be improved:

- make responsive
